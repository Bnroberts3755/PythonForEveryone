# What is Python? </br>
    Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language.Created by </br>
    Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code </br>
    readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and </br>
    object-oriented approach aims to help programmers write clear, logical code for small </br>
    and large-scale projects. </br>
