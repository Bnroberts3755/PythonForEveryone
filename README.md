# What is Python? </br>
    Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language.Created by
    Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code
    readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and
    object-oriented approach aims to help programmers write clear, logical code for small
    and large-scale projects.
# Print Statement </br>
    Print statements display output to your console.
A quick example of a print statement. </br>
    Example: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54412579/66274485-4c324700-e84d-11e9-832f-7fe5191853f0.png)
 </br>
    This print statement will output: Hello World! </br>
    Always remember that single quotes '', or double quotes "" can be used to enclose your strings. </br>
</br>
    Sometimes, your program will require your user to input something, like their name, and the </br>
    program will output what the user enters. </br>
    Example: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54412579/66274529-b5b25580-e84d-11e9-8759-956e2742c56d.png) </br>
    These two lines of code will prompt the user with 'Please Enter your name: ', and the print statement will output what the user enters. </br>
Printing a blank line. </br>
  To print a blank line between print statements for your output, there is a simple print statement you </br>
  can use. </br>
  Example: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54412579/66274538-d37fba80-e84d-11e9-8f7a-05843c8b4c62.png) </br>
  This print statement, when placed between lines of output, will essentially create a blank line of text in your output statement, creating space.
  Also, you may put a \n in the midle of a single string, to essentially line break that string. </br>
  Example: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54412579/66274596-2e191680-e84e-11e9-8d97-78ce98231dbd.png)
  You should get something along the lines of ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54412579/66274604-425d1380-e84e-11e9-8b97-3812f478f167.png) </br>
# Comments </br>
  Comments are a great way to mark down what your code was trying to do at a certain point, in case you forget. By starting a line of code with a "#," it will initiate a comment, and will not execute that line. </br>
  Example: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54412579/66275532-8ef91c80-e857-11e9-9d82-b17f56855c1b.png) </br>
  Comments will not show in the output for your program, and therefore are a handy way to leave yourself notes about your code.
# Working with Strings </br>
  Strings can be stored in variables, which are essentially placeholders within your code, that will output whatever the value is you have assigned to that variable. </br>
  Example: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54412579/66275678-05e2e500-e859-11e9-8319-69de7f02e6f6.png) </br>
  In the image, I have set up the variable, firstName, and stored a string within the variable, the string being "Brandon," in order to allow me to use firstName later in the code for various purpose. 
  One such purpose, combining strings. Strings can be combined using the "+" symbol, allowing you to put multiple variables together in a single statement. </br>
  Example: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54412579/66275730-902b4900-e859-11e9-8731-c6531f8bd497.png) </br>
  You can see the strategic use of " " added within the final line in order to create space between each variable, otherwise, you would just end up with the two varibables and no space between them.
  Now, there are some interesting things you can do with functions in order to alter a string literal that may be stored within a variable. </br>
  Example: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54412579/66275833-8ce48d00-e85a-11e9-91ba-228a5d4b49a4.png) output: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54412579/66275839-9ec63000-e85a-11e9-802e-a2feedce04af.png) </br>
  Each function alters how the variable is output depending on what you tell it to do. You can see the outputs corralate with the ".xxx" portion of the code. </br>
  Putting all of that together, while using functions for formating, will allow you to do some prety neat stuff. </br>
  Example: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54412579/66275989-36784e00-e85c-11e9-8e87-9bf2b79479ca.png) </br>
  output: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54412579/66275996-45f79700-e85c-11e9-9fa6-c2138691ca46.png) </br>
  You can see how adding the function of .capitalize will force format the user input for firstName, regardless of how they enter it, to the formatted version with the first letter capitalized. </br>
Formatting the strings </br>
Ex: ![string formatting](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54412579/68091062-319dbe80-fe49-11e9-99d0-cde3213e4d7e.PNG) </br>
Disregard errors, I did not specify firstName and lastName for the example. But these examples are each different ways to create the same output with the use of placeholders, instead of having to contiuously use the + symbol to add together strings. </br>
Output Ex: ![string format output](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54412579/68091135-fbad0a00-fe49-11e9-8588-e07623d207d3.PNG) </br> 
As you can see from the example, each format would produce this same output, regardless of how you decide to format the string.
