# Week 1 </br>
# What is Python? </br>
    Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language.Created by
    Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code
    readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and
    object-oriented approach aims to help programmers write clear, logical code for small
    and large-scale projects.
# Print Statement </br>
    Print statements display output to your console.
A quick example of a print statement. </br>
    Example: print("Hello World!") </br>
    This print statement will output: Hello World! </br>
    Always remember that single quotes '', or double quotes "" can be used to enclose your strings. </br>
</br>
    Sometimes, your program will require your user to input something, like their name, and the </br>
    program will output what the user enters. </br>
    Example: name = input("Please Enter your name: ") </br>
             print(name) </br>
    These two lines of code will prompt the user with 'Please Enter your name: ', and the print statement </br>
    will output what the user enters. </br>
Printing a blank line. </br>
  To print a blank line between print statements for your output, there is a simple print statement you </br>
  can use.
  Example: print()
  This print statement, when placed between lines of output, will essentially create a blank line of text </br>
  in your output statement, creating space.
